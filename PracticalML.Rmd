## Introduction

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Libraries used

The project uses the caret, RCurl, rpart, randomForest and e1071 (for confusionMatrix) libraries. Don't forget to install.packages() if you have not got them installed already.

```{r}

library(caret)
library(RCurl)
library(rpart)
library(randomForest)
library(e1071)

```



## Data

The training data for this project are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv


The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.

The following code downloads the testing and training data.

```{r}
filecontents <- getURL('https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv', ssl.verifyhost=FALSE, ssl.verifypeer=FALSE)
testing <- read.csv(textConnection(filecontents), header=TRUE, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

filecontents <- getURL('https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv', ssl.verifyhost=FALSE, ssl.verifypeer=FALSE)
training <- read.csv(textConnection(filecontents), header=TRUE, na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))

```

## Data cleansing

```{r}

# identify fields that are primarily empty or 'NA'
removeBecauseNA <- sapply(training, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.90

# remove these fields from the training and validation data
training <- training[, removeBecauseNA==FALSE]
testing <- testing[, removeBecauseNA==FALSE]

# remove fields that are not related to the activity itself, e.g. time, name of the subject
alltraining <- subset(training, select=(- c(X, user_name, raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_2, cvtd_timestamp, new_window, num_window)))
testing <- subset(testing, select=(- c(X, user_name, raw_timestamp_part_1, raw_timestamp_part_2, cvtd_timestamp, new_window, num_window)))

```

To assess the fitted model before applying it to the testing data, split the training data so that 25% of the records form a validation set.

```{r}

set.seed(75125)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=alltraining$classe, p=3/4, list=FALSE)
training <- alltraining[inTrain, ]
validation <- alltraining[-inTrain, ]

dim(training)
dim(validation)
dim(testing)

```

## Fitting a decision tree to the data

As a first attempt use the training data to derive a decision tree. 

```{r}

dtfit <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=training, method="class")

```
Having calculated the prediction model, I applied it to the validation data and produced the confusion matrix, in order to evaluate how good the fit is.

```{r}

dtvalidationpredictions <- predict(dtfit, validation, type="class")

confusionMatrix(dtvalidationpredictions, validation$classe)
```

This fit gave an accuracy of 73.76%.

## Fitting a random forest model to the data

For the next attempt, a random forest model was fitted to the training data. 

```{r}

rffit <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data=training, method="class")

```

Having calculated the random forest model, I applied it to the validation data to determine how good the fit was this time.

```{r}

rfvalidationpredictions <- predict(rffit, validation, type="class")

confusionMatrix(rfvalidationpredictions, validation$classe)

```

This fit gave an accuracy of 99.61%.

## Applying the model to the test data

Apply the model to the test data to obtain the prediction results.

```{r}

testingpredictions <- predict(rffit, testing, type="class")

testingpredictions

```
